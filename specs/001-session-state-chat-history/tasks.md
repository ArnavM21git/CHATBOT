# Tasks: Session State Chat History

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-session-state-chat-history/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Constitution Compliance**: All tasks must align with project principles:
- UX-FIRST: Prioritize user experience and simplicity
- INCREMENTAL-COMPLEXITY: Basic features before advanced
- TECH-STACK-LOCK: Use approved stack only (Python, Streamlit, LangChain, Gemini, FAISS, PyPDF2)
- TEST-DISCIPLINE: Include test tasks for critical paths
- DATA-PROTECTION: Secure API keys, protect user data

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL for this feature - focusing on implementation and manual testing via quickstart scenarios.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single Streamlit project**: Root-level Python files with supporting modules
- **Test structure**: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/smoke/`
- Follows existing ChatBot.py structure from plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for session state chat history

- [X] T001 Create project directory structure per implementation plan from specs/001-session-state-chat-history/plan.md
- [X] T002 [P] Create tests/unit/ directory for chat history unit tests
- [X] T003 [P] Create tests/integration/ directory for chat session integration tests
- [X] T004 [P] Create tests/smoke/ directory for Streamlit component smoke tests

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core session management infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 Implement StorageHandler class for browser sessionStorage operations in storage_handler.py
- [X] T006 Implement SessionManager class for session state coordination in session_manager.py
- [X] T007 Implement ChatHistoryManager class for chat history management in chat_history.py
- [X] T008 Create ChatMessage data structure validation utilities in chat_history.py
- [X] T009 Implement sessionStorage JavaScript integration via Streamlit components in storage_handler.py

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Persistent Chat Conversation (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to maintain conversation context across page refreshes within browser sessions, with chat history displayed in sidebar and full context preservation

**Independent Test**: Upload a document, ask 3-5 questions in sequence, refresh page, and verify all previous exchanges remain visible and contextually available

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T010 [P] [US1] Create chat history display component in sidebar section of ChatBot.py
- [X] T011 [P] [US1] Implement message input widget with submit handling in ChatBot.py
- [X] T012 [US1] Integrate ChatHistoryManager.add_message() calls for user questions in ChatBot.py
- [X] T013 [US1] Integrate ChatHistoryManager.add_message() calls for AI responses in ChatBot.py
- [X] T014 [US1] Implement chat history persistence across page refreshes using SessionManager in ChatBot.py
- [X] T015 [US1] Add visual indicators for user vs assistant messages in chat display
- [X] T016 [US1] Implement conversation context building for follow-up questions using ChatHistoryManager.get_conversation_context()
- [X] T017 [US1] Add LangChain integration for contextual responses using conversation history

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - users can have persistent conversations with context across page refreshes

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Session Isolation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Ensure complete isolation between different browser sessions/tabs, with automatic session cleanup and privacy protection

**Independent Test**: Open two browser sessions/tabs, upload different documents, have conversations in each, verify no cross-contamination, then close/reopen browser to verify session clearing

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T018 [P] [US2] Implement session ID generation and uniqueness in SessionManager.initialize_session()
- [X] T019 [P] [US2] Add session isolation validation in SessionManager
- [X] T020 [US2] Implement session data clearing on browser close behavior via sessionStorage in StorageHandler
- [X] T021 [US2] Add session status indicators in sidebar of ChatBot.py
- [X] T022 [US2] Implement cross-session data validation and isolation checks in SessionManager
- [X] T023 [US2] Add privacy protection measures for session data in StorageHandler

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - persistent conversations with complete session isolation

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Context-Aware Responses (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable AI to use conversation history for more relevant responses, avoiding repetition and building on previous exchanges

**Independent Test**: Ask follow-up questions that require context from previous exchanges, ask same question twice, verify responses acknowledge conversation history appropriately

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T024 [P] [US3] Implement conversation context aggregation in ChatHistoryManager.get_conversation_context()
- [X] T025 [P] [US3] Create conversation summary generation utilities in chat_history.py
- [X] T026 [US3] Integrate conversation context into LangChain prompt templates in ChatBot.py
- [X] T027 [US3] Implement context-aware response generation using previous conversation history
- [X] T028 [US3] Add conversation context validation and formatting for AI prompts
- [X] T029 [US3] Implement repetition detection and acknowledgment in responses

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional - full conversational AI with memory, isolation, and contextual awareness

---

## Phase 6: Edge Cases & Error Handling

**Purpose**: Handle edge cases and error scenarios defined in specification

- [X] T030 [P] Implement 50-message limit with Q&A pair cleanup in ChatHistoryManager._cleanup_if_needed()
- [X] T031 [P] Add storage failure graceful degradation with warning messages in StorageHandler
- [X] T032 [P] Implement new document upload history clearing in SessionManager.handle_new_document_upload()

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Edge Cases (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all previous phases

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 but integrates with SessionManager
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on ChatHistoryManager from US1

### Within Each User Story

- UI components before integration with managers
- Manager method calls after manager implementations exist
- Core functionality before visual enhancements
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks can run sequentially (dependencies between managers)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel
- UI components within stories marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch parallel UI components for User Story 1:
Task: "Create chat history display component in sidebar section of ChatBot.py"
Task: "Implement message input widget with submit handling in ChatBot.py"

# Then sequential integration tasks:
Task: "Integrate ChatHistoryManager.add_message() calls for user questions in ChatBot.py"
Task: "Integrate ChatHistoryManager.add_message() calls for AI responses in ChatBot.py"
```
